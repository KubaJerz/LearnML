    "In this lesson, we'll explore the concepts of batches and mini batches in depth. Why use them? How is training on batches even diffent than training on the whole Training data set? And how does using batches impact the training and performance of our models?\n",

    "- **Benefits** 💡: Why they are crucial in training deep learning models.\n",

    "We'll implement two models to put theory into practice:\n",

    "1. **Model 1**: Trained using mini batching.\n",
    "2. **Model 2**: Trained using the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate which model performs better at identifying the state (REM, wakeful, deep) of a 10-second long segment of data.\n",
    "Our data comes from **rats** 🐀 and includes 10-second long segments that are classified into one of three states: REM, wakeful, or deep sleep.\n",
